# Sisu Log Directory

Store Sisu Debugging notes here as markdown files using the naming pattern `YYYY-MM-DD-short-id.md`. Each file should contain the Sisu template from `AGENTS.md` and link to the associated issues, guardrail PRs, and follow-up tasks.

Example filename: `2025-01-10-checkout-latency.md`

Do not delete historical entries; this directory is append-only.
