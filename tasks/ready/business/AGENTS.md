**Context7:** Always resolve framework or library questions via Context7 (`context7__resolve-library-id` followed by `context7__get-library-docs`).
These initiatives have stakeholder approval and a clear go-to-market plan. They are waiting on resourcing to execute.

## Must-Haves
- Finalize the value proposition, pricing impact, and target personas; link to the latest PRD revisions.
- List committed approvers (product, finance, marketing) and capture any launch gates still pending.
- Provide success metrics and reporting cadence so analytics teams can instrument dashboards immediately.

## Execution Playbook
- Detail required collateral (enablement decks, release notes, FAQs) with assigned owners and dates.
- Include alignment points with product delivery to keep customer messaging synchronized.
- Call out legal or compliance notifications that must occur alongside implementation.

## While In Queue
- Reconfirm assumptions each sprint; if market context shifts, update the task or return it to `backlog/business`.
