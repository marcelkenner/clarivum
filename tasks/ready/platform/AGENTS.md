**Context7:** Always resolve framework or library questions via Context7 (`context7__resolve-library-id` followed by `context7__get-library-docs`).
These work items are prepared for execution on infrastructure, tooling, and developer-experience surfaces.

## Required Inputs
- Provide implementation plan details: affected environments, rollout order, and contingency steps.
- Include runbook updates, monitoring dashboards, and alerting changes that must ship with the work.
- Capture security, compliance, and cost controls so reviewers can sign off quickly.

## Collaboration Notes
- Align with backend and QA owners on integration testing and data migration checkpoints.
- Document communication plans for stakeholders (DevOps, support) and schedule any necessary maintenance windows.
- Reference ADRs or architecture diagrams to ensure changes stay consistent with policy.

## Queue Maintenance
- If tooling or dependencies drift, refresh the task or return it to `backlog/platform` for re-triage.
