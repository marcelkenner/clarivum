# Ready · Frontend Lane · AGENTS Guide

**Context7:** Always resolve framework or library questions via Context7 (`context7__resolve-library-id` followed by `context7__get-library-docs`).
Tasks here have final designs, acceptance criteria, and dependencies resolved; they are waiting for a developer to pick them up.

## Deliverables in Hand
- Attach finalized mockups or component specs with tokens, responsive breakpoints, and accessibility notes.
- Provide state management expectations, data contract details, and loading/error skeleton plans.
- Confirm performance budgets and analytics events are documented, including Flagsmith usage where relevant.

## Handoff Expectations
- Identify shared components or design system updates that other teams must review.
- Outline QA scenarios (cross-browser, mobile, assistive tech) and connect to related QA tasks.
- Note any backend/platform prerequisites and verify they are scheduled or complete.

## Pre-Start Checks
- If designs or product requirements shift, update the task immediately or send it back to `backlog/frontend`.
- Ensure reviewers and PR guidelines are referenced so the developer can ship confidently.
