## Summary
Deliver the tools-first Clarivum homepage with hero, CTA funnels, diagnostic teasers, and editorial modules exactly as specified in `docs/PRDs/requierments/ascii_designs.md` so visitors find value within 20 seconds and convert into deeper experiences.

## Definition of Ready
- [x] Finalize copy, content slots, and hero assets with marketing/design (marketing/design delivering final copy + hero specs by Sprint 02 Day 7, 17:00 UTC in `content/pages/home.v1.json` and `assets/home/`, with ASCII designs as the canonical reference).
- [x] Align component needs with library owners (hero, CTA cards, tool carousel) (UI library team owns hero/CTA cards/tool carousel variants with accessibility audits).
- [x] Confirm analytics + A/B testing requirements for each section (event model agreed: `view_*`, `click_cta_*`, `impression_card`, `scroll_75` with context payload; sticky bucketing via feature flag provider).
- [x] Define performance budgets and SEO acceptance criteria (targets: mobile LCP ≤2.5s, CLS ≤0.1, INP ≤200ms, ≤180KB JS gzip; Lighthouse ≥90 across Perf/SEO/Best Practices; ensure canonical/meta/JSON-LD requirements).

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Homepage implemented across breakpoints with pillar-specific accents and matches the ASCII design layouts/copy blocks without regression.
- [ ] Analytics instrumentation (Plausible per ADR-029), feature flags, and experiments wired per requirements.
- [ ] Core Web Vitals measured (LCP, INP, CLS) and within targets.
- [ ] Content editors trained on Strapi slots and fallback behavior.
- [ ] Launch checklist completed with QA sign-off and documentation updates.
- [ ] Acceptance criteria: All relevant README.md, AGENTS.md, and ADR documents are updated to reflect this work.
