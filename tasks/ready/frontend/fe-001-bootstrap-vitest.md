## Summary
Set up Vitest for shared frontend/backend TypeScript modules, add initial sample tests, and integrate the suite into CI and documentation.

## Definition of Ready
- [x] Scoped initial modules for coverage (server utilities, UI components).
- [x] Confirmed Node 20 runtime compatibility.
- [x] Collected lint/test pipeline expectations with DevOps.
- [x] Stakeholders (frontend/backend leads) agreed on priority.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Vitest configured with React + TS support and path aliases.
- [ ] `npm run test` script and CI workflow updates merged.
- [ ] Sample tests committed for one server component and one utility.
- [ ] Documentation updates applied (`AGENTS.md`, role guides, tasks guidelines).
- [ ] Future test backlog items captured (coverage goals, additional suites).

## Notes
Implementation can start immediately. Coordinate with QA to ensure future Vitest outputs integrate with reporting tools once Playwright lands.
