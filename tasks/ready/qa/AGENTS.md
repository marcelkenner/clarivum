# Ready · QA Lane · AGENTS Guide

**Context7:** Always resolve framework or library questions via Context7 (`context7__resolve-library-id` followed by `context7__get-library-docs`).
Quality initiatives here are fully scoped and can enter execution immediately.

## Inputs in Place
- Attach finalized test plans (manual and automated) with tooling references and data requirements.
- Confirm environment availability, credentials, and seed data instructions.
- Document acceptance criteria for defect rates, accessibility compliance, and regression coverage.

## Collaboration Points
- Cross-link to development tasks that must provide builds or feature flags before validation begins.
- Coordinate reporting cadence (dashboards, standups) so risks surface quickly.
- Provide rollback or mitigation paths aligned with the incident response runbook.

## Staying Current
- Keep checklists synchronized with CI expectations; update or de-scope promptly if priorities shift.
