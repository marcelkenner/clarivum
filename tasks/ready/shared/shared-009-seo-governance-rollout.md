## Summary
Operationalize Clarivum's SEO governance program by training stakeholders, integrating runbook rituals into the daily Kaizen cadence, and wiring metrics and reporting so policy compliance is auditable.

## Definition of Ready
- [x] Training plan drafted (agenda, outcomes, materials) and reviewed with Platform + Content leads (60-min session covering platform foundations, taxonomy/slugs, metadata factory, structured data practices, publishing checklist; reviewers: SEO lead, Content Ops, Platform).
- [x] Search Console + analytics dashboards scoped, owner assigned, and access confirmed (dashboards: Search Console performance/coverage/sitemaps owned by SEO; analytics landing page + A/B results by Product Analytics; operational Lighthouse & CWV trends by Platform).
- [x] Publishing checklist updates aligned with content operations leadership (checklist includes taxonomy IDs, title/description limits, heading structure, alt text, canonical/robots, internal links, preview QA, rollback plan).
- [x] Incident escalation paths validated against incident-response and Sisu runbooks (SEO incidents mapped to SEV-1/2/3 with channels `#seo-incidents` + PagerDuty; postmortems within 72h).
- [x] Quarterly audit cadence documented in shared calendar with responsible owners (SEO lead owns events for next four quarters plus action tracking in shared backlog; artifacts include `calendar/seo-audit-cadence.ics` and `seo/audits/YYYY-Q*.md`).

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Runbook walkthrough delivered (recording stored; attendees acknowledged responsibilities).
- [ ] Publishing checklist, task templates, and Slack reminder automations updated to include SEO checkpoints.
- [ ] Metrics ingestion (Search Console -> metrics/*.json) live with alert thresholds defined and shared.
- [ ] Policy sign-off captured from Platform, Content Ops, Marketing leadership; acknowledgements logged in tasks record.
- [ ] Forest Day + Kaizen workflows reference new guardrails and follow-up tasks created for remaining gaps.
