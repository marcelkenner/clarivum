# Ready · Shared Lane · AGENTS Guide

These cross-disciplinary items have owners, approvals, and dependencies synchronized. They are ready to start with coordinated staffing.

## Prepared Inputs
- Summarize contributions expected from each discipline and note the responsible point of contact.
- Provide timelines, communication cadences, and shared tooling references (dashboards, docs).
- Confirm compliance, security, or legal requirements are approved and documented.

## Execution Guardrails
- Break down deliverables into trackable sub-checklists so progress stays visible.
- Sync with related tasks in other lanes; note explicit integration points and rollout ordering.
- Keep runbooks, policies, or playbooks linked so every participant works from the same source.

## While Waiting
- Revalidate scope weekly; if objectives drift, return the task to `backlog/shared` for re-triage.
