# Ready Tasks

Tasks here meet Definition of Ready and can begin immediately once resourced.

- Files live in discipline lanes (`frontend/`, `backend/`, `platform/`, `qa/`, `business/`, `shared/`).
- Front matter `status` must be `ready`; update `owner`, `effort`, and `updated_at` when preparing to start.
- Keep Definition of Done explicit so handoff to QA/ops is smooth.

Move to `in-progress/` when work starts; if dependencies surface, shift back to `backlog/` or `blocked/` with notes.
