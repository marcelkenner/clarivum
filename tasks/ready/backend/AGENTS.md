# Ready · Backend Lane · AGENTS Guide

**Context7:** Always resolve framework or library questions via Context7 (`context7__resolve-library-id` followed by `context7__get-library-docs`).
These tasks are cleared for backend implementation. Developers should be able to start coding after reviewing this file.

## Required Artifacts
- Finalize API contracts, database migrations, and observability updates; link to specs or diagrams.
- Provide rollout strategy (feature flags, phased deploys) and monitoring checkpoints referencing ADR-005 for Flagsmith usage.
- Ensure non-functional requirements (latency, resilience, security) are quantified with acceptance metrics.

## Hand-off Expectations
- Confirm the owning service, repository area, and integration touchpoints are stated within the task body.
- Include validation steps for QA and platform partners: seed data, load tests, rollback plans.
- Note dependencies on context from other lanes and verify alignment during sprint kickoff.

## During Execution
- Update the task as work begins—capture branch names, PR links, or unexpected discoveries to keep the board living.
