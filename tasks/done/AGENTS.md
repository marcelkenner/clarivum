# Done Tasks Â· AGENTS Guide

This column captures the authoritative record of completed work. Keep it concise, accurate, and helpful for audits, retrospectives, and reporting.

## Documentation Checklist
- Update the `status` to `done`, confirm `updated_at`, and record actual completion dates in the summary.
- Summarize outcomes, metrics, and follow-up tasks; link to merged PRs, deployment logs, and user-facing releases.
- Note any lessons learned or ADR updates to inform future planning.

## Archival Hygiene
- Ensure Definition of Done items are checked off before moving tasks here.
- Attach or reference updated runbooks, policies, or analytics dashboards delivered by the work.
- If a task completes with outstanding follow-ups, create successor tasks in the appropriate backlog lane.

## Retrospective Use
- Review this column during weekly and quarterly retros to surface wins and inform roadmap decisions.
- Use Context7 references to point future agents toward the libraries or tools introduced by the work.
