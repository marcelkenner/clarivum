# Done Tasks

Archive completed work here for traceability and retrospectives.

- File tasks under the relevant lane (`frontend/`, `backend/`, `platform/`, `qa/`, `business/`, `shared/`).
- Ensure front matter `status` is `done` and `updated_at` reflects completion date.
- Summarize outcomes, impact metrics, and follow-up actions in the body.
- Link to merged PRs, deployment notes, dashboards, or postmortems.

Review this folder periodically to celebrate wins and identify improvement opportunities.
