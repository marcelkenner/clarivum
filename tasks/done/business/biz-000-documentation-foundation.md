## Summary
Bootstrap the Clarivum repository with a complete documentation, governance, and automation baseline so teams can deliver confidently from day zero.

## Definition of Ready
- [ ] Establish documentation structure aligned with PTRD and stakeholder expectations.
- [ ] Capture initial ADR decisions with corresponding policies and runbooks.
- [ ] Plan automation to keep AGENTS guides synchronized with repo structure.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Core documentation published (PTRD alignment, ADRs, runbooks, policies, role guides, business analyst playbook).
- [ ] `scripts/ensure-agents.mjs` generates AGENTS files automatically for new directories.
- [ ] Task board scaffolding and role-specific guides available.
- [ ] Stakeholders confirmed “golden project” experience; follow-up improvements documented in task backlog.

## Outcomes
- Baseline governance solidified; repository ready for cross-functional work.
- Clear path for future automation/testing tasks captured in backlog/ready queues.
