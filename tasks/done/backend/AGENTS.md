# Done · Backend Lane · AGENTS Guide

Record the final state of backend deliveries here so maintenance teams understand what shipped.

## Completion Notes
- Summarize the implemented changes (APIs, migrations, jobs) and link to merged PRs.
- Capture rollout details: feature flags toggled, deployment dates, and any rollback decisions.
- Document monitoring updates, alerts, and dashboards now in service.

## Follow-Up Tracking
- Note residual work (tech debt cleanup, performance tuning) and create backlog tasks when needed.
- Reference Context7 docs or ADRs updated as part of the delivery.
- Include incident or postmortem links if the work addressed a reliability action item.

## Historical Use
- Keep entries concise but informative to accelerate future audits and handovers.
