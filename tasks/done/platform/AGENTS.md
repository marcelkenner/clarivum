# Done · Platform Lane · AGENTS Guide

Capture completed infrastructure and tooling efforts so operators have a durable record.

## Final Notes
- Summarize the change (pipelines, observability, infra resources) and link to merged configuration or scripts.
- Document deployment dates, environment impacts, and any scheduled follow-up actions.
- Record monitoring alerts or dashboards now in service and their owners.

## Ongoing Maintenance
- Log required runbook or ADR updates completed; link to the relevant docs.
- Highlight residual technical debt or future phases and queue them in `backlog/platform`.
- Reference Context7 sources for tooling decisions to guide future upgrades.

## Historical Value
- Keep entries brief but precise so audits, compliance checks, and retrospectives can rely on them.
