# Backlog · Frontend Lane · AGENTS Guide

This lane holds UX and UI opportunities awaiting design fidelity, accessibility review, or technical sizing.

## Discovery Focus
- Capture the user journey, affected screens, and brand requirements (`docs/PRDs/clarivum_brand.md`).
- Link to low-fidelity mockups, design ticket numbers, or research clips; note outstanding validation steps.
- Enumerate data requirements and API assumptions so backend tickets can be drafted in parallel.

## Transition Requirements
- Definition of Ready should include component hierarchy notes, state management expectations, and performance budgets.
- Reference relevant Context7 documentation for frameworks (Next.js App Router, Tailwind CSS) when calling out implementation patterns.
- Signal cross-functional checkpoints (design QA, accessibility audit, localization) with owners and due dates.

## Hygiene
- Cull obsolete concepts after design reviews to avoid stale work.
- When prototypes or design tokens are prepared, update the task and shift it to `ready/frontend`.
