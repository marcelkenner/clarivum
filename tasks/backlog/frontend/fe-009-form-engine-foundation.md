## Definition of Done
- [ ] Form primitives (input, select, checkbox, radio, CTA) implemented with RHF + Zod.
- [ ] Validation, error states, and accessibility behavior documented and tested.
- [ ] Telemetry hooks integrated with analytics + OpenTelemetry.
- [ ] Storybook stories and usage guidelines published.
- [ ] Backlog tasks added for additional field types and advanced cases.
