## Summary
Create the shared Clarivum component library with brand-aligned tokens, accessibility guarantees, and analytics hooks so squads can assemble experiences quickly and consistently.

## Definition of Ready
- [ ] Prioritize component list (primitives + composites) with design/product.
- [ ] Align testing strategy (Vitest + RTL) and documentation expectations with QA.
- [ ] Confirm icon usage, typography, and spacing tokens with design system owners.
- [ ] Plan release strategy (packages, versioning) and CI requirements.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Core component primitives (typography, layout, CTA, forms) implemented with tests.
- [ ] Accessibility audits (keyboard, focus, ARIA) completed and documented.
- [ ] Analytics hooks + feature flag integration available for downstream use.
- [ ] Storybook stories published with usage guidelines and design references.
- [ ] Follow-up backlog captured for additional components and variant support.
