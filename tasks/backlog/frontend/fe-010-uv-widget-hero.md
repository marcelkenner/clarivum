## Summary
Deliver the hero UV widget UI and ViewModel so visitors immediately see their UV status, understand the Warsaw fallback, and can launch related SPF tools without leaving the homepage.

## Definition of Ready
- [ ] Copy blocks and risk messaging published in Strapi for PL/EN.
- [ ] Feature flag `tools.uv_widget.enabled` configured with rollout plan.
- [ ] Confirm accessible focus order and keyboard interactions with design.
- [ ] Validate API contract with platform (`/api/tools/uv-widget`).

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Hero module renders UV badge, risk copy, fallback banner, and SPF CTAs per spec.
- [ ] Geolocation consent modal and manual city selector implemented with analytics instrumentation.
- [ ] Local storage caching (30â€¯min) and optimistic refresh UX completed with tests.
- [ ] UI meets WCAG 2.2 AA (focus states, announcements, color contrast).
- [ ] Storybook scenario and screenshot tests added for high/low UV states.
- [ ] Playbook entry created for content editors on updating Strapi copy.
- [ ] Acceptance criteria: All relevant README.md, AGENTS.md, and ADR documents are updated to reflect this work.
