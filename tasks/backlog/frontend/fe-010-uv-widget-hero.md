## Summary
Deliver the hero UV widget UI and ViewModel so visitors immediately see their UV status, understand the Warsaw fallback, and can launch related SPF tools without leaving the homepage.

## Definition of Ready
- [ ] Strapi copy published for PL/EN (risk messaging, CTAs, fallback text) with owners for ongoing updates.
- [ ] Feature flag `tools.uv_widget.enabled` configured with gradual rollout plan and kill switch documented.
- [ ] Accessibility interactions confirmed (focus order, keyboard support, ARIA announcements for live UV updates).
- [ ] API contract validated with platform (`/api/tools/uv-widget`) including typed response, error handling, cache strategy.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Hero module renders UV badge, risk copy, fallback banner, and SPF CTAs per spec.
- [ ] Geolocation consent modal and manual city selector implemented with analytics instrumentation.
- [ ] Local storage caching (30 min) and optimistic refresh UX completed with tests.
- [ ] UI meets WCAG 2.2 AA (focus states, announcements, color contrast).
- [ ] Storybook scenario and screenshot tests added for high/low UV states.
- [ ] Playbook entry created for content editors on updating Strapi copy.
- [ ] Acceptance criteria: All relevant README.md, AGENTS.md, and ADR documents are updated to reflect this work.
