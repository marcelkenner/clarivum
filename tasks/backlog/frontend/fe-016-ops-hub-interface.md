## Summary
Deliver the `/ops` user interface with responsive layouts, role-aware navigation, overview dashboards, module shells (Content, Communications, Commerce, Support), global search, and color tokens aligned with Clarivumâ€™s design system.

## Definition of Ready
- [ ] UX wireframes and component specs approved by design and stakeholders.
- [ ] Accessibility requirements documented (shortcuts, focus states, color contrast).
- [ ] Data contracts with platform integration team defined (API shapes, loading states).
- [ ] Determine component reuse vs new internal tooling library needs.
- [ ] Feature flag rollout plan approved (module-level gating).

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Layout scaffolding delivered (sidebar, top nav, overview dashboard) with skeleton loaders and error banners.
- [ ] Module shells implemented with pluggable widgets and call-to-action panels for platform integrations.
- [ ] Global search, toast notifications, and confirmation modals wired with keyboard access and screen-reader support.
- [ ] Dark/light themes and locale toggles implemented; color tokens validated against WCAG.
- [ ] Storybook stories (or internal equivalent) created for reusable components, and visual regression checks captured.
- [ ] Documentation: add usage notes to design system PRD, reference in Ops Hub runbook, and update component inventory.
- [ ] Acceptance criteria: All relevant README.md, AGENTS.md, and ADR documents are updated to reflect this work.
