# Backlog · Business Lane · AGENTS Guide

Use this lane for commercial experiments, pricing initiatives, and stakeholder alignment items that are not yet actionable.

## Intake Checklist
- Clarify the customer problem, target segment, and success metrics; link to supporting PRDs or research notes.
- Capture regulatory or legal considerations early so downstream teams plan accordingly.
- Flag required approvals (finance, sales, partnerships) and note expected decision dates.

## Refinement Expectations
- Translate qualitative insights into measurable hypotheses before moving tasks to `ready/business`.
- Provide draft go-to-market messaging or collateral outlines when they influence product scope.
- Summarize any data pulls or dashboards needed; assign analytical owners so dependencies stay visible.

## Upkeep
- Prune duplicative ideas and consolidate overlapping initiatives.
- When business validation completes, add the outcome to `## Summary` and hand off with clear next actions.
