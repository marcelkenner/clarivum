# Backlog Tasks Â· AGENTS Guide

The backlog is the intake queue for ideas that need refinement before they can be scheduled. Use it for discovery, spike proposals, or initiatives pending Definition of Ready.

## Scope
- Capture problems, hypotheses, or research tasks that still need stakeholder alignment or effort sizing.
- Record context from PRDs/ADRs and required Context7 lookups so future refinement is fast.
- Avoid parking half-written implementation tasks; move those to `ready/` once DoR is satisfied.

## Authoring Checklist
- Use the `<prefix>-<sequence>-<slug>.md` naming format and keep metadata current.
- Populate `## Summary`, `## Definition of Ready`, and `## Follow-ups` with known unknowns or open questions.
- Call out dependencies (design, data, tooling) and link to owners or Slack channels for follow-up.
- When refinement resolves all open items, update `status`, adjust the checklists, and relocate the file.

## Grooming Rhythm
- Review this column during weekly planning; archive stale ideas or push them toward readiness.
- Prefer concise notes with clear next steps over detailed specs until stakeholders commit.
- If an item transitions directly into delivery, ensure the receiving lane revalidates DoR and context.
