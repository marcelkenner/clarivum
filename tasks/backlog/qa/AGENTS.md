# Backlog · QA Lane · AGENTS Guide

Use this lane for quality initiatives that need scoping—test strategy revisions, tooling research, or risk assessments.

## Intake Notes
- Outline the user flows or system behaviors at risk and link to incident reports or metrics.
- Capture assumptions about environments, data sets, and automation frameworks that need validation.
- Identify compliance or accessibility requirements that require additional research.

## Ready Criteria Preparation
- Define measurable outcomes (coverage targets, defect escape rate) and how they will be tracked.
- Provide draft test plans or suites to be expanded once the task moves to `ready/qa`.
- Coordinate with owning teams to ensure test data and infrastructure access are secured ahead of time.

## Maintenance
- Close obsolete testing ideas after retrospectives or as product scope shifts.
- Keep backlog notes concise so QA leads can prioritize during planning.
