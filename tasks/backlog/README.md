# Backlog Tasks

Store future initiatives and discovery items here before they meet Definition of Ready.

- Place each file in the appropriate discipline lane (`backend/`, `business/`, `frontend/`, `platform/`, `qa/`, `shared/`).
- Maintain YAML front matter and checklists so work is easy to promote to `ready/`.
- Capture dependencies, unknowns, and links to source docs/Context7 lookups.

Move tasks to `ready/` once all Definition of Ready items are satisfied and stakeholders approve.
