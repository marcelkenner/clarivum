## Summary
Provision Flagsmith projects for dev and prod, define environment defaults, and wire governance workflows so teams can gate features, experiments, and emergency toggles without risking regressions.

## Definition of Ready
- [ ] Finalize flag naming conventions, metadata fields, and sunset policy with product leadership.
- [ ] Confirm integration surfaces (Next.js app, background jobs, Strapi) and SDK requirements.
- [ ] Align alerting pathways with `TSK-PLAT-002` stale flag automation plan.
- [ ] Ensure secrets management approach documented for server and client SDK keys.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Flagsmith environments created with initial segment and identity configuration plus audit logging enabled.
- [ ] Default flag templates and governance documentation published, including updates to `docs/runbooks/feature-flags-operations.md`; onboarding checklist shared with teams.
- [ ] SDK credentials stored securely and injected into dev and prod builds through CI.
- [ ] Sample feature flag wired into Next.js dev environment behind guard to validate evaluation paths.
- [ ] Follow-up backlog items captured for experimentation dashboards or additional tooling.
