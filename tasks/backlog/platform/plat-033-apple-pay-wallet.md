## Summary
Provision Apple Pay through Stripeâ€™s Payment Element, including domain verification and merchant identity certificates, so iOS and Safari users can complete Clarivum purchases with a single tap.

## Definition of Ready
- [ ] Identify supported storefront domains and confirm TLS configuration for Apple Pay verification.
- [ ] Collect merchant ID, Payment Processing certificate, and Apple Pay entitlement requirements with security/legal.
- [ ] Coordinate frontend wallet placement and UX copy with design.
- [ ] Draft QA plan (Safari desktop/mobile, device simulators) and regression cases for fallback to card entry.
- [ ] Define analytics instrumentation for wallet clicks, authorizations, and declines.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Merchant IDs, certificates, and domain association completed in Stripe and Apple Developer accounts.
- [ ] Apple Pay button exposed in checkout via Stripe Payment Element with successful sandbox and live test transactions.
- [ ] Webhooks, entitlements, and ledger entries updated to flag Apple Pay transactions for reporting.
- [ ] `docs/runbooks/payments-operations.md` augmented with Apple Pay maintenance procedures; support resources briefed.
- [ ] Follow-up backlog items logged for localization, express checkout experimentation, or wallet-specific offers.
