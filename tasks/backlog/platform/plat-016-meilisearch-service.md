## Summary
Stand up Meilisearch Cloud projects, baseline indexes, and ingestion pipelines so Clarivum content (blog, tools, ebooks) is discoverable with low-latency search and editor-friendly workflows.

## Definition of Ready
- [ ] Finalize index schema and ranking rules with content and product stakeholders.
- [ ] Align ingestion sources (Strapi webhooks, Supabase sync jobs) and required credentials.
- [ ] Determine provisioning path and budget approvals for Meilisearch tenancy.
- [ ] Draft fallback plan for search downtime leveraging cached content.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Meilisearch environments provisioned with API keys, access controls, and alerting configured.
- [ ] Initial indexes populated from Strapi or Supabase data and verified with parity checks.
- [ ] Webhooks or ingestion jobs wired to refresh indexes on publish and unpublish events.
- [ ] Search operations runbook updated with tenant specifics and swap procedures.
- [ ] Follow-up tasks captured for advanced analytics, personalization, or A/B testing needs.
- [ ] Acceptance criteria: All relevant README.md, AGENTS.md, and ADR documents are updated to reflect this work.
