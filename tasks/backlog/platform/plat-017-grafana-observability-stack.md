## Summary
Deploy the Grafana Tempo, Loki, and Prometheus stack (managed or self-hosted), configure OpenTelemetry collectors, and deliver baseline dashboards and alerts that uphold Clarivumâ€™s error budget policy.

## Definition of Ready
- [ ] Confirm hosting choice (Grafana Cloud vs self-managed) and budget with leadership.
- [ ] Align telemetry schema, span naming, and retention requirements across teams.
- [ ] Inventory integration points (Next.js, Lambda workers, Strapi) and required exporters.
- [ ] Document alert routing targets (PagerDuty, Slack) and escalation paths.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Grafana stack provisioned with environments separated for dev and prod plus access controls enforced.
- [ ] OpenTelemetry collectors configured and receiving traces, logs, and metrics from key services.
- [ ] Core dashboards (Web Vitals, API latency, subscription funnel) published and shared.
- [ ] Alert policies created and tested with simulated incidents; `docs/runbooks/observability-operations.md` updated and shared with on-call engineers.
- [ ] Follow-up items filed for synthetic monitoring and cost optimization.
- [ ] Acceptance criteria: All relevant README.md, AGENTS.md, and ADR documents are updated to reflect this work.
