## Summary
Create GitHub Actions workflows and governance standards for Novu workflows, subscriber management, and secret rotation. Ensure template changes are versioned, reviewed, and synchronized across environments with automated validation.

## Definition of Ready
- [ ] Decide on workflow export format and storage location (e.g., JSON snapshots, TypeScript definitions).
- [ ] Document required Novu environments (dev, staging, prod) and promotion gates.
- [ ] Identify test subscribers and delivery channels for automated smoke checks.
- [ ] Align with security on secret rotation cadence and audit requirements.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] CI pipeline lints Novu workflow definitions, runs unit tests for notification payload builders, and blocks on failure.
- [ ] Deploy pipeline promotes workflows via Novu API/CLI with environment-specific secrets pulled from AWS Secrets Manager.
- [ ] Automated smoke test validates inbox/email delivery against seeded accounts post-deploy.
- [ ] Change management policy documented covering approvals, rollback, and audit logging.
- [ ] Follow-up tasks logged for canary rollouts, load testing, or analytics enhancements.
