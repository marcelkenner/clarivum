## Summary
Ship a GitHub Actions workflow that opens the daily Kaizen Minute issue on weekdays, avoiding duplicates and tagging the right owners so the team can reliably capture slowdowns and guardrails without manual coordination.

## Definition of Ready
- [ ] Confirm time zone, schedule (08:00 local), and ownership expectations with engineering leadership.
- [ ] Gather issue template defaults (`Kaizen Minute`) and labeling rules from `docs/AGENTS.md`.
- [ ] Ensure required repository permissions (issues:write) and GitHub token scopes are approved by security.
- [ ] Define failure alerts (Slack, email) and logging strategy for automation misfires.
- [ ] Document rollout plan, including dry run in a test repository.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Workflow committed under `.github/workflows/kaizen-daily.yml` with schedule + manual trigger, using configuration from playbook.
- [ ] Duplicate-issue guard implemented via search API; integration test or dry run demonstrates idempotency.
- [ ] Slack or alternative notification configured so owners see creation confirmation each weekday.
- [ ] Runbooks (`docs/runbooks/deployment.md`) and platform status summary updated to describe automation.
- [ ] Follow-up tasks logged for multi-timezone support or guardrail enhancements.
