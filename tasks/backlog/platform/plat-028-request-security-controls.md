## Summary
Implement centralized request security middleware that enforces country access controls, bot mitigation, and honeypot validation while emitting telemetry for governance.

## Definition of Ready
- [ ] Policy owners sign off on initial country denylist and exception workflow.
- [ ] Honeypot field naming strategy documented and aligned with design system.
- [ ] Observability acceptance criteria defined (metrics, dashboards, alert thresholds).
- [ ] Feature flags (`request-security`, `honeypot-validation`) created in Flagsmith with rollout plan.
- [ ] Middleware architecture sequence diagram drafted (per ADR-030).
- [ ] Legal/Support messaging for blocked traffic reviewed and approved.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Middleware deployed with managers for country, bot, and form hygiene per architecture.
- [ ] Configuration files versioned with automated validation and audit logging.
- [ ] Security events flowing into diagnostics platform with dashboards/alerts live.
- [ ] Honeypot integration verified across all active forms; spam rate reduced â‰¥90% vs baseline.
- [ ] Country block and override workflows documented; runbook tested in staging.
- [ ] Follow-up tasks logged for vendor evaluation or advanced detection needs.
