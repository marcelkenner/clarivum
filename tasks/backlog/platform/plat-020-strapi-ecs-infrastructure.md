## Summary
Build Terraform-managed AWS infrastructure for Strapi v5, including ECS services, load balancers, networking, and task definitions that inject secrets from AWS Secrets Manager. Ensure dev and prod workloads support blue/green deploys, health probes, autoscaling, and logging consistent with Clarivumâ€™s platform standards.

## Definition of Ready
- [ ] VPC, subnet, and security group conventions agreed with platform networking owners.
- [ ] Container image registry strategy finalized (ECR repos per environment or shared with tagging).
- [ ] Secrets catalog approved, including database DSNs, upload provider credentials, and webhook tokens.
- [ ] Observability requirements (logs, metrics, traces) signed off with reliability lead.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Terraform modules for ECS service, task definition, IAM roles, and ALB listener committed with documentation.
- [ ] Autoscaling policies configured (CPU and latency thresholds) and validated in dev.
- [ ] Task definitions mount secrets and config maps without embedding sensitive values in code or images.
- [ ] CloudWatch log groups, metrics, and alarms created; alerts wired to incident response channel.
- [ ] Deployment runbook updated with rollout/rollback procedures and health-check endpoints.
- [ ] Follow-up tasks logged for cost optimization or multi-region resiliency if needed.
