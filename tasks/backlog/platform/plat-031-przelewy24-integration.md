## Summary
Add Przelewy24 as a first-class Clarivum payment option, covering contract onboarding, API integration, webhook processing, and reconciliation so Polish users gain local payment coverage alongside Stripe and PayU.

## Definition of Ready
- [ ] Finalize merchant onboarding checklist (contracts, test credentials, settlement accounts) with finance.
- [ ] Document API flows (checkout, refunds, chargebacks) and map them to Clarivum subscription scenarios.
- [ ] Align webhook infrastructure, retry rules, and observability expectations with `TSK-PLAT-006`.
- [ ] Plan QA certification matrix, including sandbox data and manual regression steps.
- [ ] Capture compliance requirements (receipts, dispute handling, data retention) from legal.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Przelewy24 sandbox integrated with checkout, entitlements, and analytics instrumentation; QA sign-off recorded.
- [ ] Production credentials secured in AWS Secrets Manager and rotated per policy.
- [ ] Webhook handlers deployed with idempotency, signature validation, and alerting for failure scenarios.
- [ ] Finance reporting and reconciliation exports validated end-to-end.
- [ ] Support documentation and incident response playbooks updated; follow-up items logged for optimizations or new payment methods.
