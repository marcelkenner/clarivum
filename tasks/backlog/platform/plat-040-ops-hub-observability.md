## Summary
Implement tracing, metrics, logging, alerting, and compliance hooks for the Ops Hub, ensuring actions feed audit exports, SLO dashboards, and guardrail alerts, while automating monthly access reviews.

## Definition of Ready
- [ ] Align target SLOs (availability, latency) and alert thresholds with leadership.
- [ ] Identify telemetry spans, metrics, and log schemas needed for dashboards and compliance.
- [ ] Plan pipeline for exporting audit data to S3 and syncing with `sisu-log/`.
- [ ] Verify Grafana, Slack, and email alert destinations plus API tokens.
- [ ] Coordinate with analytics team on instrumentation naming conventions.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Ops Hub instrumented with OTel spans + metrics (latency, error rate, action counts) shipped to Grafana Cloud.
- [ ] Supabase audit exports automated via GitHub Action or scheduled script with retention policies.
- [ ] Alerting configured for SLO breaches, audit anomalies, and vendor API rate limits; Slack notifications validated.
- [ ] Access review automation created (monthly GitHub Action posting to `#clarivum-ops` and logging to audit trail).
- [ ] Metrics JSON files updated (flow, quality, sustainability) to include Ops Hub KPIs; documentation refreshed.
- [ ] Runbook expanded with observability dashboards, alert response expectations, and audit export instructions.
- [ ] Acceptance criteria: All relevant README.md, AGENTS.md, and ADR documents are updated to reflect this work.
