## Summary
Stand up the Auth0 tenant, applications, and role mappings required for Clarivumâ€™s web app, Strapi admin, and automation clients while enforcing MFA, least-privilege access, and EU data residency options.

## Definition of Ready
- [ ] Confirm application inventory (web app, Strapi admin, CLI/tools) and callback URLs with product and frontend teams.
- [ ] Align branding, localization, and legal copy requirements with marketing and legal stakeholders.
- [ ] Document role and permission matrix (member, subscriber, admin, reviewer) alongside auditing expectations.
- [ ] Secure budget approval for the Auth0 plan tier that meets SLA and compliance targets.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Auth0 tenant provisioned with required applications, connections, and MFA policies per ADR-002.
- [ ] Roles, permissions, and RBAC groups created; access granted to internal staff via least privilege.
- [ ] Secrets distributed via AWS Secrets Manager and CI pipelines; sample `.env.example` updated.
- [ ] Login flows smoke-tested end-to-end with Next.js dev build and Strapi admin.
- [ ] Runbooks updated with escalation contacts and incident handling for Auth0 outages.
