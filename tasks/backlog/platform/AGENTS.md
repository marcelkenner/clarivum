# Backlog · Platform Lane · AGENTS Guide

Capture infrastructure, developer-experience, and tooling concepts here until scope, risk, and sequencing are clear.

## Intake Expectations
- Describe the platform gap, impacted environments, and operational risks; cite `docs/architecture.md` and ADRs as anchors.
- Note compliance, observability, or cost considerations that influence priority.
- List integration points (CI/CD, Flagsmith, build pipelines) and any required experiments or PoCs.

## Path to Ready
- Provide proposed success metrics (build time, reliability, cost) and measurement plans.
- Attach diagrams or runbook updates that will be required once the work begins.
- Identify coordination needs with SRE, security, or finance teams before promoting to `ready/platform`.

## Ongoing Grooming
- Retire ideas once tooling changes make them obsolete.
- Keep spike outcomes summarized so future platform discussions have a single source of truth.
