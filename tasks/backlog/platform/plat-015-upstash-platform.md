## Summary
Create Upstash Redis instances, secrets, and observability hooks that power Clarivumâ€™s response cache, rate limiting, and distributed locks, ensuring alignment with edge performance guardrails.

## Definition of Ready
- [ ] Validate required namespaces, TTL policies, and throughput budgets with architecture team.
- [ ] Confirm provisioning flow (Terraform vs console) and dependencies on `TSK-PLAT-001`.
- [ ] Align monitoring dashboards and alerts with observability owners.
- [ ] Document fallback and bypass expectations for incident response.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Upstash dev and prod instances provisioned with usage alerts, IP restrictions, and token rotation schedule.
- [ ] Secrets stored in AWS Secrets Manager and injected into Next.js environments via CI.
- [ ] Cache and rate-limit libraries configured with environment variables and smoke-tested in dev.
- [ ] Grafana dashboards populated with key metrics; runbook updated with provisioning notes.
- [ ] Follow-up backlog tasks opened for cache warmers or advanced invalidation automation.
- [ ] Acceptance criteria: All relevant README.md, AGENTS.md, and ADR documents are updated to reflect this work.
