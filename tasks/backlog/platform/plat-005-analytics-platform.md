## Summary
Stand up the managed Plausible Analytics EU project, shared analytics toolkit, and governance workflows so Clarivum can capture funnel events, segment audiences, and uphold privacy commitments end-to-end without introducing alternate vendors.

## Definition of Ready
- [ ] Configure Plausible project and service accounts aligned with security baseline.
- [ ] Confirm event catalogue scope and consent requirements with product + legal.
- [ ] Align SDK rollout plan (web + server) with frontend and backend owners.
- [ ] Review runbook expectations for QA, alerting, and warehouse sync.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Plausible project provisioned with RBAC, retention, and EU residency settings.
- [ ] `@clarivum/analytics` clients deployed with event schemas validated against ADR-029 catalogue.
- [ ] CI and Playwright smoke flows emit analytics and pass QA checklist.
- [ ] Slack/Flagsmith alerts wired for anomaly detection; dashboards shared with stakeholders.
- [ ] Documentation updates merged (runbook changelog, architecture references, PRD notes).
- [ ] Acceptance criteria: All relevant README.md, AGENTS.md, and ADR documents are updated to reflect this work.
