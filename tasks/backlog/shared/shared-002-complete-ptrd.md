## Summary
Complete every section of the PTRD so the team has measurable outcomes, guardrails, and documented technical choices before any production coding begins.

## Definition of Ready
- [ ] Section owners assigned for outcomes, NFRs, architecture, data, security, testing, and operations.
- [ ] Existing ADRs, PRDs, and architecture notes reviewed for gaps against PTRD sections 0–18.
- [ ] Stakeholder workshop scheduled to validate assumptions and capture approvals.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] PTRD §§0–18 populated with quantified targets, decisions, and linked evidence.
- [ ] Go/no-go criteria recorded with explicit sign-off from product, engineering, QA, and marketing.
- [ ] Follow-up tasks logged for any deferred decisions or open risks.
- [ ] `docs/architecture.md` and relevant ADRs updated to reference finalized PTRD statements.

## Notes
This task unlocks downstream engineering and infrastructure work; do not move to `ready/` until every section has a named owner and review date.
