# Backlog · Shared Lane · AGENTS Guide

The shared lane tracks cross-disciplinary initiatives (security, analytics, content) awaiting ownership clarity.

## Intake Guidance
- Describe how the work spans multiple teams and which deliverables each discipline must provide.
- Capture dependencies on external vendors or tooling licenses; include procurement or legal notes if relevant.
- Reference the governing policy or PRD so contributors understand why the effort matters.

## Preparing for Ready
- Split the work into discipline-specific subtasks or outline a coordination plan before moving forward.
- Record communication cadences (standups, syncs) and decision forums to reduce ambiguity.
- Ensure acceptance criteria are inclusive of all participating teams and reference Context7 lookups for shared libraries.

## Lane Hygiene
- Review these items during portfolio grooming to decide whether to staff a coordinator or split into lane-specific tasks.
- Remove entries once ownership resolves and work migrates to discipline lanes in `ready/`.
