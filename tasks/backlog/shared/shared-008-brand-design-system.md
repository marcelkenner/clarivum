## Summary
Translate the Clarivum brand system into consumable design tokens, documentation, and review workflows so every surface reflects the premium KR aesthetic.

## Definition of Ready
- [ ] Finalize token naming, Figma exports, and governance cadence with design.
- [ ] Align implementation plan with component library and frontend platform teams.
- [ ] Inventory existing assets requiring retrofits (icons, typography, motion).
- [ ] Confirm accessibility and localization checkpoints with QA/legal.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Design tokens published (code + design), synchronized with Tailwind + Storybook.
- [ ] Icon usage guidelines implemented with lint checks and documentation.
- [ ] Brand review workflow established with tooling for QA (checklists, templates).
- [ ] Documentation refreshed across PRDs, ADRs, and marketing collateral.
- [ ] Follow-up tasks created for future iterations (v1.1 accents, motion updates).
