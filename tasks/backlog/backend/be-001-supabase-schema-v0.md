## Summary
Establish the initial Supabase (Postgres) schema, migrations, and indexing plan that support Clarivum's personas, content taxonomy, lead capture, and entitlements.

## Definition of Ready
- [ ] Confirm product data requirements (personas, leads, entitlements) with business analyst.
- [ ] Gather existing content taxonomy from `docs/PRDs/clarivum_brand.md`.
- [ ] Align on naming conventions, auditing columns, and soft-delete policy per PTRD ยง4.
- [ ] Document zero-downtime migration approach using Supabase CLI.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] SQL schema + migrations covering core entities (users, personas, content, entitlements).
- [ ] Index plan documented for primary queries (JOIN/WHERE/ORDER BY) with rationale.
- [ ] ADR addendum or new ADR summarizing trade-offs and future considerations.
- [ ] Seed/fixture script committed for CI and local testing.
- [ ] Documentation updates merged (`docs/architecture.md`, relevant runbooks).

## Notes
Move to `ready/` once requirements and conventions are locked. Coordinate implementation sequencing with DevOps (Terraform task) to ensure infra alignment.
