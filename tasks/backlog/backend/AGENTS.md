# Backlog · Backend Lane · AGENTS Guide

Collect server-side ideas here until the team agrees on contracts, data flow, and risk level.

## Discovery Targets
- Document the problem statement, affected services, and any upstream/downstream integrations.
- Sketch proposed API surfaces, database entities, or background jobs; keep them technology-agnostic until Context7 research confirms the approach.
- Identify operational constraints (latency, error budgets, compliance) and reference supporting ADRs.

## Ready Gate Prep
- Definition of Ready must state expected inputs/outputs, migration impact, and monitoring hooks.
- Link to draft schemas, interface definitions, or sequence diagrams so implementation work lands smoothly in `ready/backend`.
- Capture cross-team dependencies (platform, data, security) with named contacts and decision deadlines.

## Living Maintenance
- Revisit items during refinement; close loops on open questions before promoting them.
- Archive ideas that no longer align with product strategy to keep the lane signal-rich.
