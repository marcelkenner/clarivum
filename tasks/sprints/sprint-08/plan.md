# Sprint 08 Plan (Winter Weeks 9–10)

- **Window:** 2026-03-03 → 2026-03-14  
- **Sprint Goal:** Instrument, validate, and operationalize monetization telemetry so finance + partnerships can trust CTR, RPM, and payout data.  
- **Theme:** “Revenue intelligence” — pair hardened edge logging with QA monitors and Plausible/metrics pipelines.  
- **Owners:** Platform Engineer (Monetization), Analytics Lead, QA Lead, Finance Ops Lead  
- **Slack check-ins:** `#clarivum-growth`, `#clarivum-analytics`, `#clarivum-dev`, `#clarivum-qa`

## Committed Scope

| Task | Status Lane | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| [`tasks/backlog/platform/plat-043-monetization-telemetry-platform.md`](../../backlog/platform/plat-043-monetization-telemetry-platform.md) | Backlog → Ready → In-progress | Edge impression/click services, fraud detection, reconciliation |
| [`tasks/backlog/qa/qa-004-monetization-telemetry-validation.md`](../../backlog/qa/qa-004-monetization-telemetry-validation.md) | Backlog → Ready → In-progress | Playwright + synthetic monitors validating placements |
| [`tasks/backlog/platform/plat-005-analytics-platform.md`](../../backlog/platform/plat-005-analytics-platform.md) | Backlog → Ready → In-progress | Managed Plausible project + analytics SDK rollout |
| [`tasks/backlog/shared/shared-005-glossary-platform.md`](../../backlog/shared/shared-005-glossary-platform.md) | Backlog → Ready → In-progress | Ingredient glossary ingestion + UI feeding monetization placements |

### Stretch

- Add `tasks/backlog/platform/plat-019-uv-widget-open-meteo.md` instrumentation to Plausible dashboards if analytics SDK stabilizes quickly.
- Draft finance automation follow-ups (partner payout exports, billing checks).

## Definition of Success

- Monetization edge APIs log consent-aware impressions/clicks with signed redirects, Supabase storage, fraud scoring, and reconciliation jobs tied to finance SLAs.
- QA monitors (Playwright + synthetic) watch `/go/...` flows and Supabase tables hourly with Slack alerts for failures or latency spikes.
- Plausible analytics platform delivers event catalog + SDK, integrated into the homepage, Ops Hub, notification triggers, and revenue funnels.
- Cosmetic ingredients glossary ships with ingestion automation, localized UI, and analytics instrumentation to capture CTR / ingredient interest that feeds monetization strategies.
- Runbooks (analytics QA, affiliate ops, glossary editorial) updated; stakeholders trained on dashboards + anomaly response.

## Dependencies & Prep

- Confirm finance + partnerships reconciliation formats by 2026-02-26.
- Acquire Plausible API keys + service accounts; configure consent gating hooks before instrumentation.
- Collect glossary dataset + legal approvals for initial import before sprint start.
- Ensure Ops Hub (Sprint 05) dashboards have placeholders ready to display monetization KPIs fed by this work.

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Edge performance** → load-test redirect service; add circuit breakers + fallbacks for partner downtime.
- **QA signal noise** → calibrate monitors with thresholds; log to Ops Hub for triage context.
- **Glossary data churn** → script nightly validations and alert editors when ingestion fails or fields drift.

## Key Dates

- **Sprint Planning:** 2026-03-03  
- **Telemetry end-to-end test:** 2026-03-11 (edge → Supabase → dashboards → QA monitors)  
- **Demo & Retro:** 2026-03-14 (invite finance, partnerships, editorial)

Sprint 08 provides the telemetry fabric that monetization, finance, and partnerships rely on. Its dashboards + QA outputs become prerequisites for the Spring tools & personalization work in Sprint 09.
