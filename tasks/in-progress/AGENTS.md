# In-Progress Tasks · AGENTS Guide

This column tracks active execution. Keep details current so the team has real-time visibility into progress and risks.

## Expectations
- Update `status`, `owner`, `collaborators`, and `updated_at` whenever work starts or context changes.
- Capture daily notes: PR links, testing evidence, discovered scope, and decisions made.
- Flag emerging risks or blockers immediately—either move the task to `blocked/` or record mitigation steps.

## Communication
- Ensure acceptance criteria are mapped to subtasks or checklist items and mark them off as they complete.
- Sync with partner lanes (QA, platform) to coordinate hand-offs and testing windows.
- Reference Context7 lookups for any new tooling decisions introduced mid-flight.

## Exit Criteria
- Move tasks to `done/` only after Definition of Done passes; otherwise route to `blocked/` with commentary.
- If work pauses indefinitely, revert to `ready/` or `backlog/` with rationale to keep the board clean.
