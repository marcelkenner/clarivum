# In-Progress · QA Lane · AGENTS Guide

This lane hosts active verification work. Keep findings visible to accelerate triage and sign-off.

## Daily Tracking
- Log executed test suites, environments used, and data sets leveraged.
- Record defects with links to tickets/PRs and note severity or blocking impact.
- Summarize exploratory testing notes and attach artifacts (videos, screenshots) as they appear.

## Coordination
- Sync with development owners on fixes, retest schedules, and release readiness.
- Highlight automation updates and merge requests to maintain CI visibility.
- Reference Context7 documentation for any new tooling or framework decisions introduced mid-test.

## Done Criteria
- Ensure Definition of Done checklists are complete (regressions, accessibility, performance).
- Move to `done/qa` only after stakeholders sign off or re-route to `blocked/qa` with unresolved risks.
