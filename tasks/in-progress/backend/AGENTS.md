# In-Progress · Backend Lane · AGENTS Guide

Track active server-side work here with enough context for reviewers, QA, and ops partners to follow along.

## Daily Updates
- Record links to feature branches, open PRs, and deployment previews.
- Note schema migrations, seeding scripts, or infrastructure changes scheduled for today.
- Document new insights or scope adjustments and ping impacted teams immediately.

## Quality Gates
- Keep observability tasks current: dashboards, alerts, and logging updates must accompany code changes.
- Validate API contracts against agreed specs and coordinate test data with QA.
- Refer to Context7 docs when adopting new libraries; capture references in the task body for posterity.

## Exit Signals
- Once code merges and rollout checks pass, transition the task to `done/backend` with a summary of outcomes.
- If impediments arise, move the entry to `blocked/backend` and capture the actionable blocker description.
