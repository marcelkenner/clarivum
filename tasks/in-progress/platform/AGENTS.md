# In-Progress · Platform Lane · AGENTS Guide

Track active platform, DevOps, and tooling efforts here with the detail operations teams need.

## Operational Updates
- Record command snippets, scripts, or infra changes executed; include rollback notes.
- Track environment impacts (maintenance windows, migration stages) and notify stakeholders.
- Keep dashboards or alert configurations linked so reviewers can validate observability adjustments.

## Cross-Team Alignment
- Coordinate with backend/frontend owners when API gateways, build pipelines, or shared services shift.
- Capture security, compliance, or cost conversations and associated approvals.
- Reference Context7 materials for tooling upgrades to justify decisions and aid future maintenance.

## Path to Completion
- Ensure runbooks, architecture docs, and ADRs are updated before moving to `done/platform`.
- Redirect to `blocked/platform` if external dependencies (vendors, approvals) impede progress.
