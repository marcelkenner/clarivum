# In-Progress Tasks

Active work items reside here while engineering/testing is underway.

- Choose the correct lane (`frontend/`, `backend/`, `platform/`, `qa/`, `business/`, `shared/`).
- Update front matter (`status`, `owner`, `updated_at`) and add branch/PR links in the body.
- Track decisions, blockers, and progress notes so context is never lost.
- If blocked, relocate to `blocked/` and record the dependency.

After satisfying Definition of Done and QA sign-off, move tasks to `done/` with a short outcome summary.
