# In-Progress · Shared Lane · AGENTS Guide

Cross-disciplinary work happening now lives here. Maintain clarity to keep all contributors aligned.

## Coordination Checklist
- Document who is working on each discipline-specific deliverable and their current status.
- Keep shared timelines, meeting cadences, and decision logs updated.
- Record integration checkpoints (e.g., release dry runs, coordinated announcements) with owners.

## Risk Visibility
- Surface blockers quickly and capture the dependency chain so the right team can assist.
- Track open questions and assign resolution deadlines; ping stakeholders when deadlines slip.
- Include Context7 references for shared tooling or processes to ensure consistent execution.

## Exiting the Lane
- Move to `done/shared` once every participating team completes its Definition of Done.
- If coordination stalls, shift the task to `blocked/shared` with context on what is needed to resume.
