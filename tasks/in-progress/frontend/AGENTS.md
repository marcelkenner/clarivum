# In-Progress · Frontend Lane · AGENTS Guide

Active UI work belongs here. Keep details current so collaborators can review or assist quickly.

## Daily Cadence
- List branch/PR links, deployed previews, and screenshots or Looms for UX validation.
- Flag state management decisions, component splits, or design tweaks agreed with design partners.
- Capture accessibility checks performed and upcoming audit steps.

## Coordination
- Note data contract changes and sync with backend owners if payloads shift.
- Keep Tailwind or design system updates visible so others can test or reuse them.
- Reference Context7 documentation when integrating new React/Next.js APIs to guide reviewers.

## Finishing Strong
- When Definition of Done is met (tests, accessibility, analytics wired), move to `done/frontend` with a deployment note.
- If work pauses due to blockers, relocate to `blocked/frontend` with a descriptive status update.
