# In-Progress · Business Lane · AGENTS Guide

Use this lane to track active commercial and go-to-market work so stakeholders stay aligned.

## Working Notes
- Log meeting outcomes, stakeholder feedback, and decision points as they happen.
- Attach drafts (pricing sheets, positioning briefs, campaign assets) and note review status.
- Record dependencies on product delivery timelines to keep messaging in sync.

## Risk Management
- Highlight blockers (approvals, legal review, data pulls) and either resolve them or move the task to `blocked/business`.
- Keep success metrics visible; update projections or KPIs when new data arrives.
- Reference supporting docs via Context7 when citing tooling or analytics platforms.

## Completion Readiness
- Before moving to `done/business`, validate that launch materials, handoffs, and communications are scheduled and signed off.
