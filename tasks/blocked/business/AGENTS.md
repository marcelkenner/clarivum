# Blocked · Business Lane · AGENTS Guide

Business initiatives pause here when external approvals or data gaps prevent execution.

## Capture the Blocker
- Document the decision or artifact that is missing (pricing sign-off, legal review, market data) and who owns it.
- Provide context on impact: launch delay, revenue risk, customer commitments.
- Include meeting notes or email threads and set a follow-up date.

## Clearing the Path
- Escalate through the appropriate leadership channel if deadlines slip; record the escalation owner.
- Explore interim options (scope adjustments, phased rollouts) and document trade-offs.
- Reference Context7 or official documentation for tooling or analytics blockers to inform stakeholders quickly.

## Moving Forward
- Once resolved, move back to the prior lane with a summary of the resolution.
- If the initiative is shelved, return it to `backlog/business` and update the Summary with the rationale.
