# Blocked Tasks

Tasks that cannot proceed belong here until their dependencies are resolved.

- Sort into the appropriate lane (`frontend/`, `backend/`, `platform/`, `qa/`, `business/`, `shared/`).
- Update front matter (`status: blocked`) and capture blocker details (owner, dependency, ETA) in the body.
- Revisit daily; once unblocked, move back to the relevant status folder with refreshed metadata.

Escalate blockers via `#clarivum-dev` (or domain-specific channel) with a link to the task file.
