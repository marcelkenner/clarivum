# Blocked · Shared Lane · AGENTS Guide

Cross-functional work belongs here when coordination stalls.

## Detail the Impediment
- Summarize which teams are impacted and what deliverables are waiting.
- Provide links to meeting notes, decision logs, or vendor tickets and record the next follow-up.
- Highlight business impact (customer commitments, compliance deadlines) to drive urgency.

## Unlocking Guidance
- Assign a single coordinator to chase the unblock and keep stakeholders informed.
- Explore alternate sequencing or partial deliveries; capture decisions for future retrospectives.
- Reference relevant policies, runbooks, or Context7 docs to ensure decisions respect governance.

## Transitioning Out
- When progress resumes, return the task to the appropriate `in-progress` lane with a status update.
- If the initiative is paused indefinitely, move it to `backlog/shared` with rationale and owners for future review.
