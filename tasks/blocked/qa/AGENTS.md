# Blocked · QA Lane · AGENTS Guide

QA work pauses here when verification cannot continue.

## Capture the Blocker
- State whether the issue is environment stability, build availability, data quality, or tooling access.
- Link to failing pipelines, bug reports, or vendor support tickets documenting the problem.
- Assign an unblock owner and record when the next update is expected.

## Clearing Actions
- Coordinate with development or platform teams to obtain patched builds or refreshed data sets.
- Consider alternative tooling or test scope adjustments; reference Context7 when evaluating frameworks.
- Keep stakeholders informed of release risk and adjust launch plans as needed.

## After Resolution
- Move the task back to `in-progress/qa` once testing resumes and note the resolution path.
- If the effort is frozen indefinitely, escalate and decide whether to return it to `backlog/qa`.
