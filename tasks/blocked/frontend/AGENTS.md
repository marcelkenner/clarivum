# Blocked · Frontend Lane · AGENTS Guide

Front-of-house work belongs here when it cannot proceed because of upstream issues or approvals.

## Describe the Impediment
- Specify whether the block is design, data, accessibility, or infrastructure related; attach assets or error logs.
- Identify the partner responsible for unblocking and note the date of the next check-in.
- Provide interim UX decisions (placeholder content, alternate flows) considered and rejected.

## Clearing Strategy
- Coordinate with design, backend, or platform owners to secure the needed assets or API updates.
- Reconfirm assumptions against Context7 documentation if the issue stems from framework limitations.
- Keep stakeholders informed through short updates so product understands impact on launch timelines.

## After Resolution
- Move the task back to `in-progress/frontend` with a note capturing the unblocker.
- If work is deprioritized, send it to `backlog/frontend` instead of leaving it waiting here.
