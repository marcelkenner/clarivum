# Feature Requirements — Newsletter & Lifecycle Capture

> **Canonical decision:** `docs/adr/ADR-013-mailing-platform-and-campaign-automation.md` governs lifecycle messaging tooling.

## Objective
- Operate Clarivum’s newsletter capture and lifecycle messaging program, turning visitors into segmented subscribers aligned with vertical interests.
- Ensure compliance with consent regulations while delivering high-quality nurture sequences.

## Target Outcomes
- Business: grow segmented newsletter lists that feed ebook sales, tool engagement, and subscription upgrades.
- Experience: allow sign-up in under 30 seconds with clear value proposition and immediate confirmation.

## Primary Users & Segments
- Prospects opting into updates, existing customers managing preferences, partners receiving brand news.
- Segmentation: vertical interest (Skin, Fuel, Habits), lifecycle stage (lead, customer, subscriber), diagnostic outcomes, preferred language.

## Experience Principles
- Present a concise value promise (“knowledge-forward wellness”) and what content cadence to expect.
- Offer microcopy that reinforces privacy and the ability to unsubscribe anytime.
- Use component library patterns for consistency across homepage, blog, and tools placements.

## Functional Requirements
- FR1 — Provide signup modules (inline, modal, exit-intent) with configurable fields (email, vertical preference, optional name).
- FR2 — Integrate with marketing automation platform to add tags/segments and trigger welcome sequences.
- FR3 — Support double opt-in for regions requiring it; display localized confirmation messaging.
- FR4 — Offer preference center where subscribers can update vertical interests, newsletter frequency, and marketing consent.
- FR5 — Sync unsubscribe events back to profile service and analytics to prevent messaging mismatches.
- FR6 — Allow gated content (e.g., lead magnet downloads) to automatically enroll users with explicit consent capture.

## Content & Data Inputs
- Newsletter copy blocks, incentives, and sample issues stored in Strapi.
- Automation flows defined in lifecycle tool (e.g., Customer.io, Klaviyo—pending choice).
- Visual assets (hero, icons) from design system.

## Integrations & Dependencies
- Internal: analytics, profile service, diagnostics segmentation, ebook/coupon workflows, component library.
- External: marketing automation platform, transactional email service for confirmations.

## Analytics & KPIs
- Capture rate per placement, double opt-in completion rate, welcome sequence conversion (ebook sales, tool usage), churn/unsubscribe rate.
- Track deliverability metrics (bounce, spam complaints) and maintain sender reputation.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Components must load asynchronously to avoid blocking main thread.
- Ensure forms and emails are accessible (ARIA labels, correct heading structure, high contrast).
- Maintain data sync reliability ≥99%; retries for API failures.

## Compliance & Access Control
- Align with GDPR/CCPA: explicit opt-in, record timestamps and source.
- Provide easy unsubscribe mechanism in every email; update systems within 24 hours.
- Access controls: marketing manages content, legal approves compliance copy, engineering owns integration.

## Launch Readiness Checklist
- Welcome sequence content approved and scheduled.
- Consent logging verified end-to-end (form → automation → profile).
- Analytics dashboards configured to track list health.
- Support team briefed on preference center and unsubscribe flows.

## Open Questions & Assumptions
- Need selection of marketing automation tool and associated API capabilities.
- Decide on multilingual strategy for newsletter content.
- Assume newsletter will feature cross-promo modules for tools and coupons; requires design alignment.
