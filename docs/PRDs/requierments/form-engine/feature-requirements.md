# Feature Requirements — Form Engine & Validation (React Hook Form + Zod)

## Objective
- Standardize form handling across Clarivum using React Hook Form for state management and Zod for schema validation, ensuring accessible, high-conversion experiences for diagnostics, newsletter capture, checkout, and account flows.

## Target Outcomes
- Business: increase completion rates for diagnostics, newsletter signups, and checkout by delivering clear, low-friction forms.
- Experience: guarantee validation feedback within 150 ms, prevent inconsistent data, and support localization without rewrites.

## Primary Users & Segments
- External: visitors and customers interacting with lead capture, diagnostics, tools, subscriptions, and account settings.
- Internal: frontend engineers implementing forms, marketing configuring copy, legal ensuring consent capture.
- Segmentation: vertical-specific copy, authenticated vs anonymous flows, language variants.

## Experience Principles
- Keep forms concise, contextual, and supportive (progress indicators, inline tips).
- Provide real-time validation with accessible error messages and focus management.
- Reuse input components from the UI component library to maintain consistency.

## Functional Requirements
- FR1 — Create reusable form components (input, select, checkbox, radio, slider) powered by React Hook Form controllers.
- FR2 — Define Zod schemas per form capturing validation rules, localization messages, and transformation logic.
- FR3 — Support server-side validation mirrors (shared schema packages) to avoid divergence between client and API checks.
- FR4 — Provide opt-in persistence (localStorage) for long forms (diagnostics) respecting consent and privacy.
- FR5 — Integrate analytics events for form start, field errors, completion, and drop-off tracking.
- FR6 — Handle conditional fields and branching logic (diagnostics outcomes) through declarative schema definitions.
- FR7 — Offer helper utilities for multi-step forms with progress tracking and keyboard accessibility.

## Content & Data Inputs
- Copy modules for labels, helper text, error messages stored in Strapi with localization keys.
- Consent statements from legal, tied to newsletter and data usage policies.
- Pre-fill data from profile service for authenticated users.

## Integrations & Dependencies
- Internal: component library, analytics (PostHog), diagnostics engine, checkout/subscription flows, auth/profile APIs.
- External: optional service integrations (e.g., postal code validation), email service for double opt-in.

## Analytics & KPIs
- Track conversion rate per form, validation error frequency, time-to-complete, and field-level drop-off.
- Monitor bundle size impact and ensure form engine remains under 15 KB gzipped.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Ensure keyboard and screen reader support; comply with WCAG 2.2 AA (labels, focus, error messaging).
- Provide fallbacks for browsers without JavaScript (server validation responses).
- Maintain TypeScript typings for forms and DTOs; no implicit `any`.

## Compliance & Access Control
- Log consent timestamps and source; sync with newsletter and legal systems.
- Provide audit trail for schema changes impacting legal copy or mandatory fields.
- Govern access to form schema packages via code review (no runtime CMS overrides without validation).

## Launch Readiness Checklist
- Form component library documented in Storybook with accessibility notes.
- Shared schema package published and consumed by server routes.
- Analytics instrumentation verified in staging for key forms (diagnostic, newsletter, checkout).
- QA scripts executed covering localization, validation, and assistive tech scenarios.

## Open Questions & Assumptions
- Need decision on multi-language handling strategy (one schema per locale vs dynamic messages).
- Determine if we require HIPAA-like consent flows for future medical partnerships.
- Assume future mobile apps will reuse same schemas; plan deliverable as shared package.
