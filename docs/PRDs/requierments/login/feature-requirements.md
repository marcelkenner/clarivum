# Feature Requirements — Authentication & Login

> **Canonical decision:** `docs/adr/ADR-002-authentication-and-authorization.md` defines the identity provider and session model supporting this PRD.

## Objective
- Provide a secure, low-friction authentication flow that unlocks personalized experiences (saved diagnostics, ebook library, subscriptions, gated coupons).
- Balance trust and conversion by supporting progressive profiling and social/e-mail login options.

## Target Outcomes
- Business: increase conversion to registered users, reduce checkout abandonment, enable retargeting based on authenticated activity.
- Experience: complete login or sign-up in ≤ 60 seconds with clear error handling and security assurances.

## Primary Users & Segments
- Prospects purchasing ebooks or subscribing.
- Returning customers accessing purchased content or account settings.
- Segmentation: anonymous visitor, guest checkout, registered user, subscriber.

## Experience Principles
- Emphasize privacy and non-medical positioning; explain benefit of creating an account (access library, personalized tools).
- Allow one-click entry for returning users (magic link, passkey) while supporting email+password as baseline.
- Keep UI consistent with component library and brand guidelines.

## Functional Requirements
- FR1 — Support email/password sign-up with verification, passwordless options (magic link, passkey), and social login candidates (Google, Apple).
- FR2 — Provide localized forms with proper validation, inline error messaging, and accessibility compliance.
- FR3 — Enable guest checkout with gentle prompts to convert to account post-purchase.
- FR4 — Integrate MFA options for admin/internal roles and optionally for customers handling sensitive data.
- FR5 — Store session tokens securely, supporting refresh and forced logout across devices.
- FR6 — Supply APIs for other services (profile, subscriptions, analytics) to retrieve authenticated user context.

## Content & Data Inputs
- Copy for benefits, security notes, and consent statements from marketing/legal.
- Email templates for verification, password reset, login notifications (multilingual).
- Feature flags to enable/disable specific login providers.

## Integrations & Dependencies
- Internal: profile service, analytics (login events), ecommerce/checkout, diagnostics personalization, coupon gating.
- External: identity provider (Auth0, Clerk, Supabase Auth—pending ADR decision), email delivery service for transactional messages.

## Analytics & KPIs
- Metrics: sign-up conversion rate, login success rate, time-to-first-action post login, password reset volume.
- Monitor security signals (failed login attempts, suspicious activity) and trigger alerts.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Uptime SLO 99.9% for authentication endpoints.
- Response times ≤ 300 ms for login API under normal load.
- Rate-limiting and bot protection for sensitive endpoints.
- Compliance with accessibility (keyboard navigation, aria labels, focus management).

## Compliance & Access Control
- Enforce secure password policies (length, complexity) and hashing (bcrypt/argon2).
- Align with GDPR: explicit consent for marketing opt-in, ability to delete account/data.
- Admin interfaces gated with MFA and least-privilege roles.

## Launch Readiness Checklist
- Identity provider configured with production domains and secrets management.
- QA scenarios executed (sign-up, login, logout, password reset, social login fallback).
- Transactional emails tested and localized.
- Incident response playbook published for auth outages or security events.

## Open Questions & Assumptions
- Need final decision on identity provider and whether to self-host or use SaaS.
- Determine passkey support timeline and device coverage expectations.
- Assume same auth stack will serve future mobile apps; confirm API contract requirements early.
