# docs/PRDs/requierments/blog-content/habits Â· AGENTS Guide

This directory does not yet have tailored agent guidance. Use these defaults until you add project-specific notes.

- Keep changes aligned with the PTRD (`docs/PRDs/first_steps.md`) and relevant ADRs.
- Run `npm run ensure:agents` after restructuring to keep agent docs in sync.
- Follow coding standards from the root `AGENTS.md`.
- Always resolve library and framework questions via Context7 (`context7__resolve-library-id` + `context7__get-library-docs`).
- Update this file with localized best practices as soon as the directory gains dedicated responsibilities.
