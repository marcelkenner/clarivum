# Feature Requirements — Legal & Compliance Surfaces

## Objective
- Centralize mandatory legal content (privacy, terms, disclaimers) and ensure consistent disclosure across all Clarivum experiences.
- Support rapid updates as regulatory requirements evolve without requiring code changes.

## Target Outcomes
- Business: reduce compliance risk and support trust-building for ecommerce, affiliate, and educational content.
- Experience: present legal information clearly, accessibly, and contextually without disrupting conversions.

## Primary Users & Segments
- External: visitors, customers, partners seeking policy details.
- Internal: legal counsel, operations, customer support referencing authoritative content.
- Segmentation: regional variants (e.g., EU vs rest-of-world) and vertical-specific disclaimers (Skin, Fuel, Habits).

## Experience Principles
- Legal pages should be readable, scannable, and aligned with Clarivum tone (plain language where possible).
- Contextual disclosures (e.g., affiliate, non-medical, data usage) must accompany relevant modules.
- Maintain breadcrumbs and navigation for quick reference across policies.

## Functional Requirements
- FR1 — Provide top-level legal hub (`/legal/`) with links to privacy policy, terms of use, cookie policy, disclaimer, accessibility statement.
- FR2 — Support inline disclosure components for ebooks, recommendations, coupons, diagnostics, and newsletter signup.
- FR3 — Enable revision tracking with effective dates, version history, and changelog entries.
- FR4 — Offer localization and regional targeting rules managed via CMS.
- FR5 — Include request forms for data subject rights (access, deletion) routed to operations workflows.
- FR6 — Surface compliance badges (GDPR, accessibility commitments) with supporting documentation.

## Content & Data Inputs
- Policy copy maintained in Strapi or dedicated legal CMS; fields for title, summary, body, effective date, jurisdiction.
- Disclosure snippets curated per feature area; accessible via API for on-page components.
- Contact information and escalation procedures from operations documentation.

## Integrations & Dependencies
- Internal: component library (disclosure blocks), analytics (track policy views), auth/profile for DSAR submission, cookie consent tool.
- External: legal review workflow (e.g., document management system), CRM or ticketing for DSAR handling.

## Analytics & KPIs
- Track policy page views, scroll depth, DSAR submission volume, consent opt-in/out rates.
- Monitor error rates for disclosure rendering and broken links.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Policies must load statically for SEO while supporting quick updates (ISR or on-demand revalidation).
- Ensure accessible typography, table of contents, and anchor links; comply with WCAG 2.2 AA.
- Maintain uptime parity with primary site (≥99.5%).

## Compliance & Access Control
- Legal team has edit rights; publishing requires dual approval (legal + product).
- Store previous policy versions for minimum of 5 years.
- Ensure cookie management aligns with regional requirements (explicit opt-in in the EU).

## Launch Readiness Checklist
- All baseline policies authored, reviewed, and localized.
- Disclosure components implemented across dependent pages/features.
- DSAR workflow tested end-to-end (submission, acknowledgment, fulfillment).
- Update notifications process defined (email or in-app notice when policies change).

## Open Questions & Assumptions
- Need to determine whether HIPAA or other sector-specific rules apply; currently assumed out of scope.
- Clarify integration with Flagsmith or feature flags for regional messaging.
- Confirm where legal archives should reside (in CMS vs external document repository).
