# Feature Requirements — Customer Profile & Account Center

> **Canonical decision:** `docs/adr/ADR-023-account-center.md` describes the architecture and integrations for the profile experience.

## Objective
- Provide a unified account area where authenticated users manage personal data, purchases, diagnostic results, newsletter preferences, and subscriptions.
- Serve as the self-service hub reducing support load while reinforcing Clarivum’s trusted relationship with customers.

## Target Outcomes
- Business: improve retention by making it easy to access purchased content, renew subscriptions, and update preferences.
- Experience: ensure key tasks (download ebook, update profile, manage subscription) can be completed within three clicks.

## Primary Users & Segments
- Registered users who purchased ebooks or joined subscriptions.
- Prospects who created accounts via diagnostics or newsletter opt-in.
- Segmentation: role (customer vs admin), subscription status (active, paused, expired), vertical interests.

## Experience Principles
- Use calm, organized layout mirroring the design system; avoid overwhelming with options.
- Surface personalized recommendations (ebooks, tools, coupons) based on profile and diagnostic data.
- Provide transparency around data usage and give control over privacy settings.

## Functional Requirements
- FR1 — Profile overview dashboard summarizing key actions: resume last tool, access ebook library, manage subscription, view coupons.
- FR2 — Editable personal information (name, email, preferred language), privacy settings, and marketing consent.
- FR3 — Library module listing purchased ebooks with download links, update history, and support contact.
- FR4 — Diagnostics history with ability to retake or update outcomes; highlight recommended next steps.
- FR5 — Subscription management (plan details, renewal date, pause/cancel, payment method) with integration to subscription service.
- FR6 — Activity log for security (recent logins, device management) and option to sign out sessions.
- FR7 — Data export and deletion request workflows in compliance with legal requirements.

## Content & Data Inputs
- Profile data sourced from auth/user service.
- Purchase history from ecommerce/ebook system, subscription data from subscription manager.
- Diagnostic outcomes and segmentation tags from diagnostics service.
- Personalized recommendations via Strapi entries or recommendation engine.

## Integrations & Dependencies
- Internal: authentication, subscriptions, ebooks, diagnostics, coupons, newsletter preference APIs, analytics.
- External: payment processor for billing updates, support ticketing for escalations.

## Analytics & KPIs
- Track feature usage (ebook downloads, subscription changes), churn triggers, and cross-sell conversions.
- Monitor time-on-task for key flows and error rates (e.g., failed payment updates).

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Ensure secure handling of personal data; all sensitive operations require re-authentication (step-up).
- Performance: dashboard loads within 2 s, subsequent modules lazy-load asynchronously.
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.2 AA, including keyboard navigation and screen reader support.

## Compliance & Access Control
- Enforce least privilege: customers access only their data, admins require elevated roles with audit logs.
- Honor data retention policies and provide clear messaging about stored information.
- Support GDPR/CCPA DSAR processes.

## Launch Readiness Checklist
- User testing conducted with representative personas.
- QA coverage for CRUD operations, subscription changes, and data export.
- Incident playbook for account-related outages documented.
- Support team trained on account center features to assist customers.

## Open Questions & Assumptions
- Need design decision on navigation pattern (tabs vs sidebar).
- Determine whether profile will host messaging inbox or rely on email only.
- Assume feature will extend to mobile app in future—API contracts should anticipate cross-platform use.
