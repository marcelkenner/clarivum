# Operations Hub PRDs Â· AGENTS Guide

- Follow the standard PRD template from `docs/PRDs/requierments/_template.md`.
- Cross-link every requirement to ADR-031 and relevant runbooks (`docs/runbooks/ops-hub.md`) to keep architecture and operations aligned.
- Resolve any library or API questions through Context7 (e.g., `/vercel/next.js`, `/auth0/auth0-spa-js`, `/octokit/rest.js`).
- Keep content ASCII; include tables or checklists when specifying module-level requirements.
- Update this file if package-specific scripts or validation steps emerge for ops features.
