# Feature Requirements — Storybook Design System Workbench

> **Canonical decision:** `docs/adr/ADR-027-component-library-and-storybook.md` defines the Storybook and component governance model.

## Objective
- Provide a Storybook workspace documenting Clarivum’s component library, design tokens, and interaction patterns, enabling designers, engineers, and content stakeholders to collaborate and review UI changes in isolation.

## Target Outcomes
- Business: shorten review cycles and reduce regressions by making UI states visible and testable before release.
- Experience: ensure every shared component has interactive examples, accessibility notes, and usage guidelines.

## Primary Users & Segments
- Internal: frontend engineers, designers, QA, marketing reviewers.
- Segmentation: component categories (layout, typography, forms, CTAs, diagnostics modules), vertical theming variants (Skin, Fuel, Habits).

## Experience Principles
- Keep documentation concise yet practical: include props tables, best practices, and do/don’t examples.
- Highlight accessibility checkpoints (keyboard interaction, ARIA roles, color contrast).
- Align component stories with real-world use cases from PRDs to maintain context.

## Functional Requirements
- FR1 — Configure Storybook with Next.js + Tailwind support, enabling server components stories where applicable.
- FR2 — Auto-generate controls/args from TypeScript props for interactive tweaking.
- FR3 — Organize stories by component responsibility and vertical variant.
- FR4 — Integrate Storybook Docs MDX pages for complex patterns (forms, diagnostics flows).
- FR5 — Include visual regression testing (Chromatic or Storybook Test Runner) with CI integration.
- FR6 — Surface accessibility checks (storybook/addon-a11y) and viewport testing.
- FR7 — Provide link-outs or embeds of design specs and Figma references when available.

## Content & Data Inputs
- Component metadata (props, usage notes) maintained in code; doc blocks rendered in Storybook.
- Sample content pulled from Strapi fixtures or inline mocks aligned with PRDs.
- Accessibility annotations from design system team.

## Integrations & Dependencies
- Internal: component library, Tailwind config, analytics instrumentation (optional story overlay), testing stack (Vitest/Test Runner).
- External: Chromatic (optional) for visual diffing, design tools (Figma) for source-of-truth links.

## Analytics & KPIs
- Track Storybook adoption (last view timestamps, contributors), visual regression coverage, and number of components documented vs total.
- Monitor time between component change and Storybook update as indicator of library health.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Ensure Storybook build completes under 5 minutes in CI to keep feedback loops tight.
- Host authenticated Storybook instance for stakeholders; protect preview links with password or SSO.
- Keep static build size manageable (<250 MB) for storage and deployment.

## Compliance & Access Control
- Limit public exposure of in-progress designs; restrict access to internal team.
- Maintain versioned documentation aligned with releases; archive outdated stories.
- Capture approvals for components critical to regulated messaging (legal disclaimers).

## Launch Readiness Checklist
- Storybook project scaffolded with CI pipeline (build + lint + visual tests).
- Core primitives documented: typography, color tokens, buttons, cards, forms, CTA modules.
- Accessibility addon enabled with baseline checks passing.
- Developer onboarding guide updated with Storybook usage instructions.

## Open Questions & Assumptions
- Decide on hosting (Chromatic vs Vercel preview) and access controls.
- Determine schedule for design QA sessions using Storybook (e.g., weekly review).
- Assume we will expand Storybook to document content snippets (copy blocks) later; plan taxonomy accordingly.
