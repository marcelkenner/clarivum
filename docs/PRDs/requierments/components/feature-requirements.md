# Feature Requirements — UI Component Library

> **Canonical decisions:** Adhere to `docs/adr/ADR-027-component-library-and-storybook.md`, the brand system (`docs/adr/ADR-018-brand-design-system.md`), and icon guidelines (`docs/adr/ADR-017-icon-system.md`).

## Objective
- Deliver a reusable, design-system-aligned component library that embodies Clarivum’s brand guidelines and supports rapid assembly of pages across verticals.
- Reduce duplicate UI code by centralizing patterns for CTAs, cards, forms, and navigation.

## Target Outcomes
- Business: decrease time-to-launch for new vertical pages and campaigns by ≥30%.
- Experience: maintain visual coherence, accessibility, and performance across all experiences while enabling theme accents per vertical.

## Primary Users & Segments
- Internal consumers: frontend developers, designers, content editors configuring layouts.
- Segmentation: base components with optional accent variants for `skin`, `fuel`, `habits`.

## Experience Principles
- Follow the Clarivum Brand Design System `brand_design_system.md` (color tokens, typography, spacing, motion).
- Components must be composable, stateless when possible, and support dependency injection for data and callbacks.
- Single-responsibility: each component handles one function (e.g., CTA button vs CTA section wrapper).

## Functional Requirements
- FR1 — Provide foundational primitives: typography, grid, spacing helpers, color tokens, icon wrapper.
- FR2 — Build key marketing components: hero blocks, CTA cards, tool cards, testimonial sliders, newsletter forms, coupon tiles.
- FR3 — Offer accessibility-ready form controls (labels, error states, focus rings) with easy hook integration.
- FR4 — Expose configuration for vertical accenting without duplicating logic (e.g., `accent="fuel"` prop).
- FR5 — Support analytics instrumentation hooks so components emit standardized events.
- FR6 — Ship Storybook or equivalent documentation site with usage guidelines and variants.

## Content & Data Inputs
- Token definitions from design system.
- Copy and imagery references from Strapi entries; components render placeholders when data missing.

## Integrations & Dependencies
- Internal: Next.js App Router, Tailwind CSS tokens, analytics dispatcher, feature flag manager.
- External: Icon library (e.g., custom SVG set), Storybook infrastructure.

## Analytics & KPIs
- Track component adoption coverage (% of pages using shared components vs bespoke).
- Monitor performance budgets per component (render cost, hydration footprint).
- Capture A/B test readiness for CTA modules (Variant support).

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Enforce file size budgets (<5 KB per component bundle when tree-shaken).
- 100% of interactive components must pass WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility tests.
- Provide TypeScript definitions and unit tests covering critical props and behaviors.

## Compliance & Access Control
- Document token usage to avoid color combinations that fail accessibility thresholds.
- Restrict modification of base tokens to design system maintainers; component consumers can extend via props only.

## Launch Readiness Checklist
- Component inventory reviewed with design.
- Storybook hosted with authentication and linked from developer docs.
- Automated visual regression tests configured for critical marketing components.
- Governance plan published (versioning, deprecation policy).

## Open Questions & Assumptions
- Need confirmation on motion library (Framer Motion vs CSS only) to finalize dependencies.
- Determine if components should ship as internal npm package or via shared workspace directory.
- Assume icon set will be delivered by design; requires asset handoff schedule.
