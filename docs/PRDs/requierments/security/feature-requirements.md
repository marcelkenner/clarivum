# Feature Requirements — Security & Trust

> **Canonical decisions:** `docs/adr/ADR-028-security-and-compliance-baseline.md` defines the security posture; `docs/adr/ADR-007-secrets-management-and-configuration-distribution.md` covers secret rotation.

## Objective
- Establish security controls that protect user data, uphold brand trust, and satisfy the guardrails defined in the PTRD (`first_steps.md`).
- Embed secure-by-default practices across infrastructure, product, and operations.

## Target Outcomes
- Business: avoid security incidents that could erode customer trust or cause regulatory penalties.
- Experience: provide transparent security assurances without adding friction to legitimate user flows.

## Primary Users & Segments
- Internal stakeholders: engineering, DevOps, security champion, legal/compliance.
- External: customers who need confidence in data handling (especially for diagnostics, purchases, subscriptions).
- Segmentation: user roles (customer, admin, partner).

## Experience Principles
- Security messaging should be clear, calm, and in line with Clarivum tone—no fear-based language.
- Build security into shared components (e.g., forms, account management) to avoid ad-hoc implementations.
- Support principle of least privilege and auditable access.

## Functional Requirements
- FR1 — Implement centralized secrets management, environment hardening, and automated dependency scanning.
- FR2 — Provide role-based access control (RBAC) for internal tools and CMS, including MFA for privileged accounts.
- FR3 — Enable security logging and monitoring with alerting for anomalous behaviors (auth failures, rate limit breaches).
- FR4 — Maintain vulnerability management workflow (triage SLA, remediation tracking, disclosure).
- FR5 — Deliver secure data transit (TLS 1.2+) and data at rest encryption (database, storage).
- FR6 — Provide incident response runbook aligned with error-budget policy (freeze features when needed).
- FR7 — Integrate content security policies, rate limiting, and bot mitigation at the edge.

## Content & Data Inputs
- Security policy documentation, runbooks, contact info stored alongside legal docs.
- Configuration data for RBAC roles, audit trails stored in logging infrastructure.
- Threat models and risk assessments documented for critical features (auth, payments, CMS).

## Integrations & Dependencies
- Internal: authentication system, CMS (Strapi), analytics, infrastructure automation (CI/CD), observability stack (from ADRs).
- External: security tooling (Snyk, Dependabot, WAF provider, SIEM).

## Analytics & KPIs
- Track number of high-severity vulnerabilities open vs resolved, mean time to resolve, failed login trends, rate of blocked malicious requests.
- Monitor compliance adherence (audit log coverage, MFA adoption).

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Security controls must not introduce >200 ms latency per request; use edge caches and asynchronous checks where possible.
- Systems must support 99.9% availability for auth and profile services.
- Ensure accessibility of security UX (e.g., MFA prompts) and localization where required.

## Compliance & Access Control
- Align with GDPR/CCPA data protection requirements; document data flows.
- Maintain audit logs retained for ≥12 months.
- Conduct annual security review and penetration testing; track remediation.
- Ensure third-party vendors sign DPAs and meet security standards.

## Launch Readiness Checklist
- Baseline security posture assessment complete; high-risk gaps remediated.
- Incident response plan tested via tabletop exercise.
- Secrets inventory documented; rotation policy enacted.
- Security awareness training rolled out to relevant team members.

## Open Questions & Assumptions
- Need clarity on target compliance frameworks (ISO 27001 vs SOC 2) for future roadmap.
- Determine ownership model (internal security champion vs external partner).
- Assume observability stack will include logging and alerting capable of supporting security use cases; confirm tooling selection.
