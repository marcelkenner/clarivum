# Feature Requirements — Feature Flags & Experimentation (Flagsmith)

## Objective
- Manage progressive delivery, controlled rollouts, and lightweight experiments across Clarivum experiences using Flagsmith.
- Empower product and marketing to test messaging or reveal gated features without additional deployments.

## Target Outcomes
- Business: reduce release risk and enable segmented launches that improve conversion rates.
- Experience: ensure flag evaluations add <50 ms to request lifecycle and fail safely with cached defaults.

## Primary Users & Segments
- Internal: engineering (flag creation), product/marketing (production toggles), QA (scenario testing).
- Segmentation: environment (dev/staging/prod), user roles (anonymous, lead, customer, subscriber), vertical focus, cohort tags from diagnostics.

## Experience Principles
- Flags should be small in scope, owned, and time-boxed; no long-lived toggles without documented sunset.
- Provide human-readable flag naming and descriptions to avoid misuse.
- Keep fallbacks graceful so users never see unfinished UI or errors due to flag latency.

## Functional Requirements
- FR1 — Integrate Flagsmith SDK for server-side (Next.js server components, route handlers) and client-side usage with hydration-safe providers.
- FR2 — Cache flag payloads with 5-minute TTL and implement circuit breakers when Flagsmith API is unavailable.
- FR3 — Expose configuration for targeting rules (segments) tied to diagnostics outcomes, profile attributes, and campaign metadata.
- FR4 — Provide admin dashboard access with RBAC (product can toggle production flags; engineering retains create/edit rights).
- FR5 — Log flag evaluations and changes to Grafana Loki for auditing and rollback analysis.
- FR6 — Automate stale flag detection (weekly CI job) that notifies owners when `sunset_date` passes.
- FR7 — Support multivariate flags for A/B messaging in CTAs and tools.

## Content & Data Inputs
- Flag metadata: name, description, owner, rollout plan, sunset date stored in Flagsmith tags; mirrored in documentation exports.
- Segment definitions derived from analytics and diagnostics data; maintain canonical list to avoid drift.

## Integrations & Dependencies
- Internal: frontend platform (providers), analytics (to attribute experiments), diagnostics/profile services (segment attributes), CI tooling for reports.
- External: Flagsmith SaaS (EU region) with API keys managed via secrets manager.

## Analytics & KPIs
- Track experiment lift (conversion delta per variant), flag rollout stability (error rate vs control), and toggle frequency.
- Measure flag-induced latency and cache hit rates to ensure performance budgets respected.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Evaluate flags during server render when possible; avoid blocking client hydration.
- Ensure SDK upgrades follow Flagsmith release notes within 30 days.
- Provide resilience to network failures (default to safe values and log incidents).

## Compliance & Access Control
- Enforce dual-approval workflow for production toggles (engineering + product).
- Maintain audit logs for 12 months; integrate with security monitoring.
- Align with GDPR by avoiding storing PII in flag identities; use hashed identifiers instead.

## Launch Readiness Checklist
- SDK wired into app shell with provider pattern.
- Initial flag inventory documented (e.g., homepage hero CTA test, gated coupons).
- CI job for stale flag reporting implemented.
- Runbook updated with fallback procedure if Flagsmith outage occurs.

## Open Questions & Assumptions
- Need to confirm whether marketing requires self-serve segment creation or if engineering will manage.
- Determine long-term plan for experimentation analysis (Flagsmith vs PostHog integration).
- Assume serverless runtime limits (Vercel Edge) will be considered later; evaluate edge SDK readiness before adoption.
