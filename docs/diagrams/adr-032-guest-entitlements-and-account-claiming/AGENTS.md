## Directory Purpose

- `data-lineage.mmd`: Storage and reporting paths for entitlements, profiles, and analytics.
- `uml-components.mmd`: Component relationships powering the entitlement shelf UI and APIs.
- `sequence-guest-claim.mmd`: End-to-end sequence from Stripe checkout to account claim completion.

## Contribution Checklist
- Validate Mermaid syntax with `npm run lint:diagrams` before committing.
- Cross-link updates in the ADR and associated runbooks when diagrams change materially.
- Capture Context7 citations when introducing new tooling or service references.
- Coordinate with platform + growth squads to confirm data retention and consent assumptions remain accurate.
