# Role Guides · AGENTS Guide

Purpose-built guides live here for each discipline. Keep them accurate, actionable, and aligned with current ADRs/runbooks.

- When updating workflows, reflect changes in the relevant role guide and cross-link to source docs.
- Link to Context7 documentation when referencing framework APIs or third-party tooling.
- Include ownership/contact info and “ask for help” channels so new contributors know where to go.
- Update the index (`README.md`) whenever a new role guide is added or renamed.
- The `continuous-improvement.md` guide captures the Kaizen/Sisu cadence (daily 6+1, Forest Day, seasonal focus, metrics); keep it current with the root `AGENTS.md` and runbook updates.
