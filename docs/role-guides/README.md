# Role Guides Index

Each guide helps a specific discipline ramp quickly on Clarivum. Start here, then dive into the guide for your role.

- `frontend.md` – App Router structure, branding alignment, UI workflow.
- `backend.md` – API and data modelling approach, Supabase/SQS integration plans.
- `architecture.md` – Decision records, review cadence, and modelling expectations.
- `devops.md` – IaC, environments, deployments, observability, cost controls.
- `qa.md` – Testing strategy, tooling, and CI guardrails.
- `business-analyst.md` – Senior Business/System Analyst playbook covering flows, copy, and documentation sources.
- `planning.md` – Intake, slicing, and cross-functional task workflow guidance.
- `continuous-improvement.md` – Kaizen/Sisu cadence (daily 6+1, Forest Days, seasonal focus, metrics, guardrail rituals).

If a workflow is missing or unclear, open an issue titled `[Docs] <topic>` or drop a note in `#clarivum-dev` (Slack) so we can add it quickly.
