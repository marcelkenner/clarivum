# ADR-010: Content Management Platform
Date: 2025-10-21
Status: Accepted

## Context
- Clarivumâ€™s editorial roadmap (blog, ebooks, diagnostic copy) needs structured authoring, localization, and medical review workflows managed outside the application codebase.
- Editors require rich custom components, scheduled releases, and SEO controls aligned with the Strapi PRDs while engineering must keep schemas version-controlled.
- Small team size (<4 engineers) and GDPR obligations favour a managed solution with EU-hosted data and minimal DevOps overhead.
- Content deploys must integrate with Next.js ISR revalidation, feature flag metadata, and search webhooks while providing extensible APIs (REST + GraphQL).
- Requirements are outlined in `docs/PRDs/requierments/strapi/feature-requirements.md` and operational setup guidance in `docs/PRDs/requierments/strapi/setup.md`.

## Decision
- Standardize on **Strapi v5**, hosted on **Strapi Cloud (EU region)** for managed infrastructure and compliance.
  - Use Strapi Cloud CLI deployment flow (`strapi deploy` per Context7 `/strapi/documentation`) from the dedicated `cms/` workspace, ensuring reproducible builds and environment parity.
  - Configure Postgres backing storage via Strapi Cloud; mirror nightly backups to Supabase for DR alignment with ADR-001.
- Define the CMS solution architecture:
  - Create separate Strapi environments (`dev`, `prod`) mapped to Clarivum promotion flow; content migrations promoted via Git-based configuration packages.
  - Model content types/components according to the Strapi blog requirements, enforcing Draft & Publish, localization, and workflow stages.
  - Expose read-only REST & GraphQL endpoints with API tokens scoped by environment; integrate rate limiting (ADR-006) to shield from abuse.
  - Webhooks trigger Next.js revalidation, Meilisearch indexing (ADR-009), and lifecycle analytics.
- Bundle custom admin extensions (e.g., medical review tools) as Strapi plugins stored in `cms/plugins/`, built into the admin panel during `yarn build` (Context7 notes on admin build pipeline).
- Manage secrets via AWS Secrets Manager sync (ADR-007); Strapi Cloud environment variables pull from centralized store during deployment.

## Consequences
- **Benefits:** Managed Strapi reduces ops toil, delivers editorial UX, and keeps schemas/versioning under engineer control while meeting localization and workflow needs.
- **Trade-offs:** Strapi Cloud introduces license cost and limited infra customization; mitigated by periodic cost reviews and fallback playbook for self-hosting if required.
- **Operational notes:** Strapi upgrade cadence (v5 minor releases) must be tracked quarterly; regression tests run against the dev environment before promotion.
- **Follow-ups:**
  - Document editorial onboarding and role permissions in `docs/role-guides/editorial.md`.
  - Implement automated schema diffs to surface breaking changes during PR review.
  - Establish SLA for webhook processing and add alerting for failed revalidation/indexing jobs.
